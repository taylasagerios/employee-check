# employee-check
Employee-check is a way for a business owner to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they can organize and plan for their business

The code used in this repo is Node.js and sql. We installed and ran inquier@8.2.4., and package.json. For sql we used tables, schema, insert, and query. We created three tables one for departments, another for roles and finally employees. The department table carried an id and name. Roles table carried id, title, salary and department_id. The employees table had id, first and last name, role_id and manger_id.
